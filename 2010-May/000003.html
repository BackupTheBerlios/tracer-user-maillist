Until I can allocate the time to do a full demo, I'll try to help you
with the separate items.

&gt;<i> 1. a point source of light, monochromatic, a point from which the ray comes
</I>&gt;<i> out.
</I>
To create a general source, you create a RayBundle object, which is
still only documented in the source (tracer/ray_bundle.py), I'll fix
that soon. A ray bundle gets as parameters at least a (3,n) array of
vertices (starting positions) for n rays; and a similar array of
directions. So you would do something like that:

import numpy as np
from tracer.ray_bundle import RayBundle

directs = your_preferred_distribution()
point_source = N.c_[[src_x, src_y, src_z]]
num_rays = 1000 # or however many you want.
pos = np.tile(point_source, (num_rays, 1))
energy = np.ones(num_rays)

# And finally:
source = RayBundle(pos, direct, energy=energy)

&gt;<i> 2. a first mirror that sees the light at some angle (back mirrors)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. a second mirror that sees the first mirror (one of the four surfaces on
</I>&gt;<i> the rhombic surface)
</I>
You didn't answer my question on the optics, I still didn't get
whether it's actual mirrors (reflective surfaces) or refractive
surfaces. If it's a reflective surface you can use
tracer.models.one_sided_mirror.rect_one_sided_mirror. Refracrive,
something like this:

############
from tracer.surface import Surface
from tracer.flat_surface import RectPlate
from tracer.object import AssembledObject
import tracer.optics_callables as opt

# Back surface:
back = Surface(RectPlate(width, height), opt.Refractive(n1=1, n2=1.5))
# 4 Facets:
facets = [back]
for loc in facet_locations: # locations relative to back surface
    rot = ... # 3x3 rotation matrix, remembering the surface's normal
is the local Z axis
    facet = Surface(RectPlate(width, height), opt.Refractive(n1=1, n2=1.5),
        location=loc, rotation=rot)
    facets.append(facet)

# All together now:
fourview = AssembledObject(facets)
################3

This you put into an assembly (tracer.assembly.Assembly) with an
object for the system and objects for the cameras.

&gt;<i> 4. a light detector (a camera).
</I>
Take a look at tracer.models.one_sided_mirror.rect_one_sided_receiver,
or at tracer.optics_callables.ReflectiveReceiver.

As to the process of performing a trace with that assembly, there's an
elaborate example in examples/tower_gui.py in _fmap_btn_fired().

&gt;<i> Then our design is actually a replication of this design 4 times, when every
</I>&gt;<i> time the point source is coming from another corner of a rectangle and what
</I>&gt;<i> we want to see is the point where the light hits when it originates from the
</I>&gt;<i> four different corners of the rectangle.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance,
</I>
No problem. Again, I know the documentation needs some work, but I
hope this helps in the meantime.
